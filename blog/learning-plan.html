    <hr class="line-break-top">


    <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
    <p>I'd like to become frontend develop and work my way up to full stack. However long term goal would be to 
      learn to code for blockchain technology. Eventually would love to move to Japan after I gain enough experience and work
      remotely for an overseas company. Preferably something in web3.</p>

      <p>
        Flexibility to move around at anytime without worry of losing a job would be my long term goal. Being able to go out there
        travel and visit friends and family is all part of ultimate values in my life.
      </p>
    

<strong>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</strong>

<p>My strengths: Motivation, communication, time management and the willingness to help others. Being able to immerse myself into the topics I'm interested in and absorb as 
  much information as I can.</p>
<p>My limitations: Knowing when to rest. I continuously strive to achieve perfection and don't allow myself time to relax.
</p>

<strong>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
<p>The ability to talk in a group small or big, I struggle to communicate well in front of people and especially new people I've never
  met before. I'm usually ok with one on one or people I know extremely well.
</p>
<strong>
  An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</strong>
  <p>Communicating well with team mates, facilitators and practically anyone else who we'll be working with in the future and treat them with respect. Build relationships
    and understand each other.  </p>
  <strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong>
 <p>Let someone know, stop, take a breather and take my dogs out for a walk. Come back relax for 15 minutes and talk to someone in my team about it.
  Let them know I'm struggling. We're only human, we can't let ourselves get too overwhelmed. We're here to learn, help and support each other.
 </p>
  <strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong>
<p>If I'm stuck on a particular problem for long period of time, I would check to see how long I've spent on it due to my toggl app. 
  If it's longer than the time allocated then I would begin to ask my team mates or facilitators.
</p>

<strong>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong>
<p>Mainly support when I'm stuck on problem and clear and easy communication.</p>
<strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</strong>
<p>Usually give up 2 hours for lunch time to make my lunch, dinner and take my dogs out for a walk. From 9pm until I fall asleep is allocated for Netflix (NO EXCEPTIONS). Sundays are my day off and if 
  any Marvel movies are currently screening my time is allocated to that as well :)
</p>

<p><em>Thank you for reading my learning plan...</em></p>
