    <hr class="line-break-top">


    <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
    <p>I'd like to become frontend develop and work my way up to full stack. However long term goal would be to 
      learn to code for blockchain technology. Eventually would love to move to Japan after I gain enough experience and work
      remotely for an overseas company. Preferably something in web3.</p>

      <p>
        Flexibility to move around at anytime without worry of losing a job would be my long term goal. Being able to go out there
        travel and visit friends and family is all part of ultimate values in my life.
      </p>
    

<strong>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</strong>

<p>My strengths: Motivation, communication, time management and the willingness to help others. Being able to immerse myself into the topics I'm interested in and absorb as 
  much information as I can.</p>
<p>My limitations: Knowing when to rest. I continuously strive to achieve perfection and don't allow myself time to relax.
</p>

<strong>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
<p>The ability to talk in a group small or big, I struggle to communicate well in front of people and especially new people I've never
  met before. I'm usually ok with one on one or people I know extremely well.
</p>
<strong>
  An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</strong>
  <p>Communicating well with team mates, facilitators and practically anyone else who we'll be working with in the future and treat them with respect. Build relationships
    and understand each other.  </p>
  <strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong>
 <p>Let someone know, stop, take a breather and take my dogs out for a walk. Come back relax for 15 minutes and talk to someone in my team about it.
  Let them know I'm struggling. We're only human, we can't let ourselves get too overwhelmed. We're here to learn, help and support each other.
 </p>
  <strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong>
<p>If I'm stuck on a particular problem for long period of time, I would check to see how long I've spent on it due to my toggl app. 
  If it's longer than the time allocated then I would begin to ask my team mates or facilitators.
</p>

<strong>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong>
<p>Mainly support when I'm stuck on problem and clear and easy communication.</p>
<strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</strong>
<p>Usually give up 2 hours for lunch time to make my lunch, dinner and take my dogs out for a walk. From 9pm until I fall asleep is allocated for Netflix (NO EXCEPTIONS). Sundays are my day off and if 
  any Marvel movies are currently screening my time is allocated to that as well :)
</p>

<p><em>Thank you for reading my learning plan...</em></p>


<h1>Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h1> 

<strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong>

<p>I've always enjoyed helping others and I realised during the past month in foundations its been very rewarding helping others who are struggling in the sprints after completing my own.  My values and plans have been set for over a year so  have no intentions of changing my career pathways. However I would enjoy helping others learn coding while working in a web development industry.</p>
<p class="reflections"><em>Week 4 of bootcamp</em></p>
<p class="reflections">I feel like this hasn't changed much. I still enjoy helping others in my cohort especially in the areas I have solid understanding in. In terms of career path long term I would like to head into frontend React as I really enjoy seeing the visual changes as I code. The backend development side of thing doesn't interest me as much but I can do it as well. So fullstack developer wouldn't be too bad but I wouldn't go just backend on its own as a career.</p>

<strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong>
<strong><em>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</em></strong>

<p>I realised my strength is the ability to complete task on time while helping and guiding others learn. 
  I also found I have issues listening and fully understanding instructions and being able to recall what needs to be done for example looping and listening.</p>

  <p class="reflections"><em>Week 4 of bootcamp</em></p>
<p class="reflections">I feel like I understand concepts easier if there are examples I can see and play around with especially with clear instructions. My weakness is still listening and fully understanding instructions and looping when listening to someone speak. I find I need to push myself to ask questions when needed and be able to give feedback on the fly.  My strength I found in the group projects is that I'm very flexible and understanding when it comes to dealing with everyone in a team. I understand their struggles when they're stuck in a particular problem, that it takes time and patience to deal with those issues and allow them to breath and understand that its allowing other team members to continue on what they need to do in their task.</p>

<strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong>

<strong>
  <p>While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine weeks, etc.
    I've known for a long time this is one of the things I struggle with.</p>
</strong>


  <strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
<strong><em>At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?</em></strong>





  <em><strong>For example, this could be communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self-awareness and reflective skills.</strong></em>

  <p>Same as usual.</p>

  <p class="reflections"><em>Week 4 of bootcamp</em></p>
<p class="reflections">I've helped alot of people in our cohort and one of the things I'm aware of is, I dont recieve feedback properly in a sense where I thank them for it. This is whether its good or bad, for some reason I just don't say much or kinda freeze and appreciate the moment when someone says something to me and I almost get the feeling like I need to give them a good feedback in return. I Would like to work on my feedback when it comes to a group environment. In person I can usually give good constructive feeback where it helps the other person grow but when it comes to group environment I'm always afraid of what others would say and think of.</p>

<strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong>

<strong>
  <p>What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is helpful to voice these expectations.</p>
</strong>

  <p>Mainly support when I'm stuck on problem and clear and easy communication just as I would in the foundations part of Dev Academy.</p>

  <p class="reflections"><em>Week 4 of bootcamp</em></p>
  <p class="reflections">The support during bootcamp has been amazing! Both students and Bootcamp team has been very helpful in helping me through my blockage times. It took me awhile to ask for help but I'm finding it extremely useful as it cuts down in time when I'm trying to figure something out. When I call in a facilitator, they usually help me understand the problem and move forward and definitely helps me learn instead of researching things that could be irrelevant to the problem.</p>


  <strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong>

  <p class="reflections"><em>Week 4 of bootcamp</em></p>
  <p class="reflections">To be able to learn as much as I can understand code when searching for documentations online. Before I started Dev Academy, I've always had problems understanding documentations and implementing them in my projects. However now I find that when I look up documentations or even read other peoples code I have much better understand of what it all means. Readibility has definitely become a lot easier for me since I started Dev Academy. I would like to be able to pick up someone elses code and read it and understand it to at least 60%.  </p>

<strong><em>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</em></strong>

  <em><strong>Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</strong></em>
  

  <p>My commitment towards Bootcamp will not change compared to foundations learning plan. I will commit 5 and half days towards bootcamp from 8.30am to 6pm Monday to Friday with 2 hours lunch break each day. On Saturdays I would usually work up until 2pm unless I'm stuck or one of my team members need help. </p>

    <p>I will continue my studies and working on projects until 10pm. Anytime after that will be allocated to Netflix and other superhero movies/tv shows. As mentioned in my foundations learning plan, Sundays are my day off and if any Marvel movies are currently screening my time is allocated to that as well :)</p>

    <p class="reflections"><em>Week 4 of bootcamp</em></p>
    <p class="reflections">I think this has slightly changed in terms of scheduling. My wife usually has one of the weekends off. So for our wellbeing I decided to have that particular day off and the other days I would study until 10pm, sometimes 11pm. This depends on how well I understand the concept on the week.</p>

    <p class="reflections">I guess would ask for help as soon as I'm stuck for 15 minutes without researching solutions really struggling to move foward. I would for support. On the human skills side of things, if I'm burnt out or really struggling emotionally I would usually like to talk to my wife about it as she is my main support in life and I appreciate her help as we always help each other in times of need.</p>


    <p class="reflections">I still allow time to walk my dogs, spend time with my wife and go out for lunch or dinners. We watch fair amount of Netflix each night. </p>
