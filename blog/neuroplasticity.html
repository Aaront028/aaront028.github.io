    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1> 

    <hr class="line-break-top">

    <h2>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h2>
    
    <p>Keeping the brain busy is the way to keep healthy and effective. It creates pathways to what you've learned. The more you practice the more it will become permanent. It is a way to rewire your brain in order to learn new things.</p>

    <h2>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h2>
      <p>
        Get better sleep to help with stress relief. It helps your body adapt to stress. Do new things, practice as it creates new pathways and helps your brain to become more neuroplastic.
      </p>
    <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <p>Music, dance, gaming and exercise.</p>

    <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant?</h2>

    <p>Its when you know you can grow your ability to learn. When you learn new things in a classroom many people compare their skills to others and think oh they're better than me. In actuality I think and would compare myself to someone else who has higher score than me and does better, I would usually see that is how far I'll ever get. Almost like a road block .</p>

    <p>However, if I see that person has a higher score than me and think that is where I want to get to and better the score and know I can reach that level. I'm setting myself a road map and allowing myself to grow.</p>

    <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
      <p>I've explored mindset and neuroplasticity before and practice mindset over the past few years. This helped change me as a person and my ability to learn and help others.</p>

      <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
      <p>Understand the difference between fixed and growth mindset. Believing that I can learn from practice, struggle and challenges. Without the struggles we dont learn.</p>

      <h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>

      <p>Being able to understand how our brain works and grow shapes who you are and to get better at what you do consistently. Its a good idea to have a learning plan so that you have something to look forward to. Understanding your strength and weakness so that you're aware of them and it may influence your growth mindset and neuroplasticity and where you could actually improve.</p>
