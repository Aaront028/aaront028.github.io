    <h2>What was the problem I was facing?</h2>

    <p>
      The problem I was blocked in was the concatMyArray. I tried to solve this problem by entering the strings through a for loop and found that I was stuck at pushing a string to an empty variable string.</p>
    <p> <strong>"2: failed - concatMyArray should return a string where all the strings in the given array have been joined together."</strong>  I kept trying various things but it kept showing in the test </p>
      
      <code>Recieved: "" 
        
        Expected: was 
        "zoomzoom!"
      </code>
    <p>After receiving the error message above, I googled how to join an array of string into one string. Immediately came up with the <strong>join()</strong> method. Read through the documentation and realised it was actually a lot easier than expected. You just need to add the array then <strong>join()</strong>  and <strong>''</strong> without spaces like example below. 
      <code>array.join('')</code>
      The outcome will be <strong>"thisisastring"</strong> and if you typed in <strong>array.join(' ')</strong> this will create spaces in between each word.</p>

      <p>I was frustrated because if googled first how to join array of strings into one i could've completed that challenge a lot sooner.</p>

      <p>I learned before starting the challenge its a good idea to check if there's an actually method to make the code easier to write without too many lines and also read the instructions properly.</p>
    
      <h2>Elegantly solved a problem</h2>
      
      <p>I was able to solve the SuperFizzBuzz fairly quickly. This is only because I've done this many times in different formats and requirements. It was fun being able to solve this one with ease.</p>
      

      <p>I usually break it down using pseudocode then wrote out each if and else statements so that its much easier to manage. Once I wrote the code for the first fizzbuzz function and passed then I copied and paste the existing code into a for loop. I couldn't figure out why it wasn't looping through and return the correct outcome. So I decided to use my fizzbuzz function inside the loop passing each of the array item, created an empty array and pushed into new array and returned the new array with fizz buzz included.</p>
      
      <p>I felt great being able to complete this challenge quickly without too many problems. Although after completing it realised why my previous test with super_fizzbuzz didn't work and that was because I never created an empty array and returned it.</p>
      
      <p>I learned how to call another function within a function to cut down on length of code and make more readable.</p>

      <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>

      <p>Before writing any code I always try my best to read and follow the instructions given then write  out some pseudocode that can help me understand and break it down so it's easier to manage.</p>

      <p>After I have a fair idea of what I'm coding usually try out things that I already know that could solve it. Sometimes the error messages returns something that I could work with and it helps me understand what to do next.</p>

      <p>Often I try to talk to someone about it instead of talking to rubber ducky which I don't own. Occasionally talk to my dogs but they just look at me blankly and then it hits me, suddenly I have a solution.  If I don't have a solution to the error message I'll usually look for the problem on the line given in the message.</p>

      <p>Sometimes its great to use console.log to see ifWhile problem solving I've always have steps to follow. Which is very much the same as above and writing down the road blocks I've encountered helps me understand the problem. the code inside the blocks are actually working the way it should be. Often if I have a particular code not behaving as it should, I place it inside the console.log and usually this would give me some ideas of what's happening in that particular area.</p>

      <p>Google is great! I often copy and paste or google the error message or problem I am facing. Majority of the time I end up reading something from StackOverflow and scroll down until theres a solution I prefer and understand how to use.</p>
      
      <p>I don't often ask for help as I prefer to try and solve the solution myself. Unless I've spent a long time on the problem and tried all of the above.   I was stuck on one particular issue for a long time and found a manual solution to the problem  but wasn't happy with it and mentioned to Joseph, who helped me through understanding the issue.
