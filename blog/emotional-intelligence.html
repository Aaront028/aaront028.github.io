    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1> 
 

  <strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong>
    <p>
      Enable us to connect with patience, insight and imagination, relationship with ourselves and people.
      Realising sensitivity towards  other peoples emotions e.g outburst can be an out call for help.
      A measurement of your awareness to your own and other peoples emotions. Self awareness, social skills
      and the ability to manage relationships.
    </p>
<strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong>
    <p>Measurement qualities of our intelligence. </p>
<strong>Why is it important?</strong>
    <p>
      It can be very important to a workplace, especially when working within a team because of the
      different personalities traits in every person. We all react differently and can potential hurt
      someone in the process of communication. This can be due to frustration, jealousy or even anger.
       If we have a reasonable level of EQ this helps us understand ourselves and others around us to
       relate and understand the emotions and react appropriately. EQ can help us understand ourselves
       and other people to make our lives much better.
