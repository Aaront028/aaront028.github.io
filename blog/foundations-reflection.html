    <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
      I learned when I understand things I need to explain it to someone else clearly for it to fully stick to my mind.</h2>
    
    <p>That I enjoy looping and listening even though I know that is my weakness and especially remember what people are saying but that is ok because I can always ask and make sure I've listened and gathered the correct information given.
      I find that I always want to keep helping people and it benefits me in learning that particular material and helps them as well.</p>

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

      <p>I think role of empathy and self-awareness are important because programming is hard! We all know the struggle to code something that looks simple on a webpage but in reality is quite difficult unless you know how to do it and have the patience, understanding and awareness to the process of getting it to work properly.</p>
      <p>
        Helping others understand this is an important value in learning and programming. If you don't understand this and help them and get frustrated with them, it could easily push them away to doing something else and they will most likely be unwilling to learn in the future which encourages the fixed mindset we covered in earlier core.
      </p>

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>

    <p>The idea of neuroplasticity. I've always heard of it but never really put it into action and understood the concept completely. Being able to shape your mind and expand in growth mindset is just fascinating and makes sense of the things I am able to do in the past and present, including the materials learned in this course to this date. I can already feel that my mind is growing and learning faster than ever before.</p>

    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>

    <p>Looping and listening has always been my challenge. I can listen fine but trying remember everything that has been said is extremely hard to me. Sometimes I feel like I have a memory of a goldfish. Although I am surprised that I can recall most things that has been said in listening and looping sessions the last couple of weeks. I have pushed myself several times to do this exercises even though I've already completed it with someone else. I'm always happen to practice more and more to the point I can loop back without issues.</p>



    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>

      <p>I think its important to focus on core learning regardless of web development course. Its important life skill for work life and personal life. People need to know these things to be able to treat each other with respect, understand their own capabilities, build relationships and create a better version of themselves which can also enhance work culture.</p>

      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>

      <p>Definitely not, I absolutely love the core learning and think it should be taught in school.</p>
