    <p> Position properties controls how elements on websites are positioned

      There are 5 values in the position properties
      static, relative, fixed, absolute and sticky
      
      In this article we'll talk about absolute, relative and fixed positioning and how they're different.
      
      For the purpose of understanding these three positions, we'll need to briefly explain how static 
      positioning works. By default the document flow will automatically assign your element as static,
       which is the normal flow of a document. Elements are laid out in blocks stacked from top to bottom 
       unless we specifically assign positions to them. 
      
      Within the position element you can also use the properties top, right, left and bottom to lay out
       your elements to where you want them placed.
      
      **image placed**
      
      The top and bottom affects vertical position of an element
      
      **image placed**
      
      right and left affects horizontal position of an element
      
      As mentioned above all elements are "position: static" by default. All of the positions below can be 
      moved with the properties top, right, left and bottom.
      
      Relative = Appears in its original position, One thing to note is that this activates the z-index which
      means you can place an element overlapping another elements or underneath other elements. By default
      this position will automatically have the z-index property to over lap. It also activates the scope of 
      absolute positioning mentioned below. 
      
      **insert image**
      
      Absolute = This value is usually removed from the flow relative to its original OR the closest parent 
      other than the position static. If there are no parent positions it will move along to the body document 
      and position from there. Using the properties top, right, left and bottom will position the element 
      exactly where you want.
      
      Fixed = This is when the element is fixed to the viewport (size of screen), meaning if you add 
      "bottom: 0;" this will place the element on the bottom of the page even if you scroll it will 
      still be there but wont be in sight if you have a lot of content written and scrolled to the top 
      of the page. Fixed positions are often used to place a footer at the bottom of the page.</p>
