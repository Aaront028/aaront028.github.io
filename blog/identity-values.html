    <strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</strong>
        
    <p>
      At one of the kitchens I worked at there was a kitchen hand who didn't particularly like the head chef. The head chef treated him terribly because he was slow and always wanted to leave work early so that he could head to his next job as he worked at two different places.
          This person, lets name him John for privacy sake, asked me for advice about whether he should quit this job or the other job as he really wanted to become a chef. John didn't have experience and he wanted to be a chef badly. Head chef wanted to get rid of him but I asked him to give him a chance.
          3 months went by and he was getting better but still receiving a lot of negative feedback from the head chef. By then, John wanted to quit. My advice to John "You're doing fine give it time, everyone learns and progress at different speed and you're also working a full time job elsewhere while working here part time give yourself some credit". He decided to stay and actually improved dramatically, finishing earlier than usual and picked up the pace. However he left this job as he was promoted in his other full time job.
          In my opinion he was a great kitchen hand and we were short in staff but I wanted what was best for him not for myself or the head chef. The consequence that we had to struggle with a slow kitchen hand for a couple of months but in the end John got he wanted and we all ended in good terms plus a new experienced kitchen hand replacement.

    <strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong>

        <p>
          I brought up a christian and my mother has always said to me, treat others the way you like to be treated, love yourself and love others. My friends and family have always been most important in my life. They have always been there for me and I have always been there them. 
          Using the evidence galine-break-topgths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</strong>
       
    <p>I'm self motivated, creative, passionate in anything that I put my mind to. I love a challenge, I learn best by doing things and talking to others about it. My limitations are over working myself, usually working from morning until late at night,  not knowing when to stop.</p>

          line-break-topposition as I am friends with both team leader and John and it sucks to see him silent treat her because of that. He eventually calmed down after I had a chat with and they eventually talked to each other again.
          I think I handled the situation well, as I did everything I possibly could and spoke to both John and team leader. We all work together, its awkward that he silent treated her. They don' t need to like each other but they can definitely respect each others opinions and decisions. Team leader was fine with him  but John wouldn't let it go, even after convincing him she was just doing her job. He was the type who wouldn't let things go because he was so angry on such a small matter, so there nothing more I could say to him without sparking more flames.
