    <h1>Hello...</h1> 

    <hr class="line-break-top">

    <p>I am an entrepreneur who had set up a self-service sushi bar in Christchurch and a 
    mushroom growing business supplying to local cafes, restaurants, and markets.</p>

    <p>I've always wanted to become a developer ever since high school. Back then 
    I thought you need to be good at maths to become a programmer, I was terrible at maths
    and the worst at many other subjects so I didn't pursue that dream.</p>
    
    <p>During the period of running my own business for 8 years, I have found myself 
    drawn back to programming and more specifically web development. The skills I have gained
    from studying Diploma in Photography have helped me thrive in the design aspect of 
    developing a website using Squarespace which further enhanced my interest to pursue this career.
    I enjoy problem solving even if it takes me to early hours of the morning to find the right solution.</p>
    
    <p><strong><em>Was tired of the physical, high pressure, long hours and no social life. </em></strong></p>
      
    <p>All of the above made 
    me realise I am more capable than I give myself credit and decided to pursue my developer dream. 
    Being apart of digital innovation is exciting, the constant learning is what I live for!</p>
    
    <p>I enjoy spending time with my wife and my two amazing hyperactive dogs. Our dogs (border collies) 
    are a huge part of our life and we love them to bits!</p>
